== About ==

"Jerome's Keywords" is a plugin for WordPress 1.5 to tag your posts with relevant keywords. You can use these keywords in several ways:

1. Add them to your page header: e.g. {{{<meta name="keywords" content="list of page keywords">}}} [[BR]]
These tags used to be important to search engines, but not so much anymore. Regardless, this is an easy way to create a relevant keywords <meta> tag.

2. Implements Technorati tags — more fun than meta tags! Normally if you're indexed with Technorati they'll only pick up your categories as tags. With this plugin, all of your keywords show up in their tag pages too.

3. Implements a local tag system! Readers can click on a post's keyword/tag link to see other posts with the same tag. It's another simple but effective way of letting users find content that interests them.
